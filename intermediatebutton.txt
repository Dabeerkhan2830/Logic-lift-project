Problem
Hint / Guidance
1.
Find all prime numbers in a given range
Use a loop and the prime check logic for each number.
2.
Find the missing number in an array (1 to N)
Use sum formula or XOR logic.
3.
Find the duplicate element in an array
Use nested loops or a hash map to track seen elements.
4.
Check if two strings are anagrams
Sort both strings or count character frequencies.
5.
Remove all duplicates from an array/string
Use an auxiliary array or set.
6.
Find the first non-repeating character in a string
Count occurrences using a map or array of frequency.
7.
Check if a number is an Armstrong number
Sum of digits raised to power of number of digits equals number.
8.
Print all factors of a number
Loop from 1 to √n and print divisors.
9.
Find the intersection and union of two arrays
Use loops or sets to track common and unique elements.
10.
Reverse the words in a sentence
Split by spaces and reverse the list of words.
11.
Find the longest word in a string
Split string and compare lengths of each word.
12.
Check if a string is a valid palindrome ignoring spaces & case
Remove spaces, convert to lower, then compare.
13.
Implement binary search
Divide array by mid index; move left/right accordingly.
14.
Implement bubble sort / insertion sort manually
Understand swapping adjacent or inserting in order.
15.
Find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray (Kadane’s Algorithm)
Track current sum and global max while traversing.
16.
Count the number of words in a sentence
Increment count whenever a space follows a word.
17.
Find frequency of digits in a number
Convert to string or use %10 repeatedly.
18.
Print half pyramid or diamond pattern using * symbols
Use nested loops for rows and columns.
19.
Calculate power of a number (aⁿ) without using pow()
Use loop or recursion.
20.
Check if an array is sorted (ascending or descending)
Compare each element with the next.
